# Chess Guess Mode Debugging Instructions

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Evaluation logic tested and working perfectly (all 6 test cases pass)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite created in test-evaluation-logic.js
- ‚úÖ Debug functions added to app.js
- ‚ùå Issue still exists: wrong best moves shown for black/evaluation problems

## Debug Steps to Identify Root Cause

### Steps to Run:
1. Load a game and turn on guess mode (üéØ Guess Mode: ON)
2. Wait for analysis to complete (until you see best move stored in console)
3. Run in browser console: `debugRealIssue()`
4. Make a move by dragging a piece
5. Check console output to identify the problem

### What the Debug Will Show:
- ‚ùå **Missing analysis data** ‚Üí Problem with data storage
- ‚ùå **evaluateAlternativeMove returns null** ‚Üí Problem with async evaluation  
- ‚úÖ **Logic works but wrong display** ‚Üí Problem with feedback display
- ‚úÖ **Everything works** ‚Üí Problem somewhere else entirely

## Known Issues to Investigate:
1. **Wrong best move for black**: Shows white moves (like d2d4) when black to move
2. **Evaluation perspective**: May not be properly adjusting for black's perspective
3. **Async callback chain**: evaluateAlternativeMove might be failing
4. **Move parsing**: UCI to Chess.js conversion might have issues

## Test Files Created:
- `test-evaluation-logic.js` - Tests core evaluation logic (PASSING)
- `test-guess-mode.html` - Browser-based comprehensive test suite
- `debug-real-issue.js` - Debug function (now integrated in app.js)

## Functions Available for Debugging:
- `debugRealIssue()` - Main debug function to identify root cause
- `debugGuessMode()` - Test evaluation with stored best move
- Both functions are available in browser console when app is loaded

## Suspected Root Causes (in order of likelihood):
1. **evaluateAlternativeMove async function failing** - Most likely
2. **Data storage timing issues** - bestMoveAtPosition not set when needed  
3. **Move parsing in UCI format** - Chess.js compatibility issues
4. **Evaluation adjustment logic** - Though tests show this works

## Next Actions After Debug:
1. Run debugRealIssue() to identify exact failure point
2. Fix the identified issue systematically
3. Re-test with the same debug function
4. Create regression test to prevent future issues

## Notes:
- The core evaluation logic is mathematically correct (proven by tests)
- The issue is in the data flow, not the algorithm
- Focus debugging on async operations and data timing
